## Project Description

Research Question:

For the final project, I plan to analyze news headlines from popular news media in the US, and potentially foreign news media also. I am interested in exploring whether political bias or national bias affect the news coverage. The research questions I aim to answer are: 1. What are the trends of news topics? Does the media cover news topics or political figures selectively, based on their political leaning?  2. Does the tone of news headlines affect the political leaning of the news media?


Data:

I have collected news media frontpages of 45 sites, from allsides.com featured media list, every two hours since 1/1/24. I am also collecting frontpages from 20 international news media outlets on a regular interval. So far, I have about 150,000 unique headlines for US news media, where each headline includes its text and a link to the full-length article.


Method:

I plan to use NER, sentiment analysis, word embedding and clustering (for news media) in the project. I also plan to label some news data and fine-tune a pre-existing language model, likely LLM, for the sentiment analysis task specific to news headlines.
